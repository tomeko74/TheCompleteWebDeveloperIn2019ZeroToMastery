//Solve these problems:

//#1 Create a one line function that adds adds two parameters
const sum = (a, b) => a + b

//Closure: What does the last line return?
//Closure: a function ran, the function executed, it's ner gonna be executed again.
//BUT it's going to remember that there are references to those variables so the
//child scope always has access to the parent scope (not vice versa)
const addTo = x => y => x + y
var addToTen = addTo(10)
addToTen(3) // returns 13

//Currying: What does the last line return?
const sum = (a, b) => a + b
const curriedSum = (a) => (b) => a + b
curriedSum(30)(1) // 31


//Currying: What does the last line return?
const sum = (a, b) => a + b
const curriedSum = (a) => (b) => a + b
const add5 = curriedSum(5)
add5(12) // 17

//Composing: What does the last line return?
const compose = (f, g) => (a) => f(g(a));
const add1 = (num) => num + 1;
const add5 = (num) => num + 5;
compose(add1, add5)(10) // 16

//What are the two elements of a pure function?
1. Deterministic --> always produces the same results given the same inputs
2. No Side Effects -->  It does not depend on any state, or data, change during a programâ€™s execution. It must only depend on its input elements.
